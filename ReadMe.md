# Starter Template

If you like this and/or use it. Please buy me a cup of coffee. I like drinking Starbucks ðŸ˜—. Sure it will save a ton of startup time.

### Before you can use this you have to setup firebase and set varibles in .env file or just replace everything in src/config. Also set project name for firebase .firebaserc


### - Vite
### - ReactJS
### - Firebase
### - Mantine UI
### - ReactFire
### - Zustand
### - Lodash
### - FontAwesome

In my opinion, this is the best template for building a startup or an application quickly. Making available for other developers, it already has a firebase auth setup and Mantine UI Light/Dark Theme with AppShell.
